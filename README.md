Since I have been working primarily with Jave backend (see Algorithms Part 1 + 2) and React frontend (see Blockudoku), I was interested in learning how to connect the two. 

To my surprise it was very easy to make the connection - simply making requests to the backend to retrieve and store the requred information. 

In this course, we learned how to upload an image using drag and drop and then downloading the image to view when loading the page. We used Amazon S3 to store the images. This course was very thorough in how to set up the backend to connect to Amazon S3 and the frontend to connect to Spring Boot. 

You will definietly learn a lot in just under two an a half hours, I highly recommend the tutorial!
